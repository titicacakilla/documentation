kind: faq

* Traffic is always initiated by the agent to Datadog. No sessions are ever initiated from Datadog back to the agent.
* All traffic is sent over SSL.
* All communication to Datadog is via HTTPS.
* [The full license agreement](https://app.datadoghq.com/policy/license).
* [The agent is entirely open source](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/).
* Some installations (for example, installing the agent on CentOS 5), requests your password. The password is needed because it's installing packages - Datadog does not retain it in any way. You can also use the step-by-step directions if you prefer to see exactly what the script is doing.
